I have tried to connect to CouchDB with the following two addresses:

- <a href="#" id="couchDBurl" data-type="text"></a> (CouchDB)

- <a href="#" id="corsProxy" data-type="text" ></a> (Cors proxy)

Neither of them gave back a valid response.

Please correct them (by clicking on them) and then click the connect button or refresh the page.

<button class="btn btn-small btn-primary" ng-click="connect()">Connect</button>
