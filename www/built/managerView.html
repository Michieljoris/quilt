</ul>

<p>More help:</p>

<p>If you still can't connect this could be for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have not installed CouchDB.</p>

<p>Please download CouchDB for windows from <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/couchdb/binary/win/1.3.1/setup-couchdb-1.3.1_R15B03-1.exe">here</a>,
for mac <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/couchdb/binary/mac/1.3.1/Apache-CouchDB-1.3.1.zip">here</a> and linux <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/couchdb/source/1.3.1/apache-couchdb-1.3.1.tar.gz">here</a>.
Installing is a matter of just clicking Next. There is one step that
asks you wheter you want run the database as a service. If you say
'No' you will have to manually start CouchDB on every restart of your computer.
After downloading and installing come back to this page.</p></li>
<li><p>CouchDB is installed but is not configured properly (which it isn't
after a fresh install).</p>

<p>You can remedy this by doing one of the following:</p>

<ol><li><p>Download this little <a href="cors-proxy.zip">utility</a>. Unzip its content
somewhere on you hard drive and double click the cors-proxy.bat in the unzipped
folder.  Under Linux install node.js first, then execute "node server.js". That should
work on a Mac as well. Then come back to this page and refresh
or click the connect button. This proxy server assumes your CouchDB
instance is on http;//localhost:5984<p>
I will then try to configure CouchDb to enable access without having to
use this little utility. This will only work with a CouchDB that is
not locked down yet with a server admin password (as is the case
after a fresh install). <p>
This is the simplest solution for a fresh install.</p></li>
<li><p>Download this <a href="local.ini">file</a>. In windows copy this to
C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software
Foundation\CouchDB\etc\couchdb\local.ini. In Linux it is somewhere
like /usr/local/etc/couchdb/local.ini Overwrite the file that's
there already. Restart the CouchDB service, or restart the
computer. CouchDB should now be accessible from this site. <br>
<strong><em>Warning: Don't do this if you or somebody else has already configured CouchDB at  all. Besides clobbering current settings, it also will remove any existing server admins and set up a new admin (with password admin).</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you know what you're doing go to the database config page, most
likely <a href="http://localhost:5984/_utils/config.html">here</a> for a local
install. If your CouchDB is on a network somewhere you will need to
replace the <em>localhost:5984</em> part of this address with the proper address and
port. <p> 
You will need server admin credentials for a locked down CouchDB. On
a fresh install you don't. Look for the option <strong>enable_cors</strong> and
change its value to <strong>true</strong>. Look for the <strong>credentials</strong> options and
change its value to <strong>true</strong>. Then go to the bottom of the page and
click <strong>Add a new section</strong>. Fill in <strong>cors</strong>, <strong>origins</strong> and <strong>*</strong>
for <strong>section</strong>, <strong>option</strong> and <strong>value</strong> respectively. Refresh this page or click the
connect button.</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>CouchDB is installed and configured properly but neither of the addresses entered
at the top of the page are correct. </p>

<ul><li><p>Carefully check the addresses you've
entered. If the cors proxy address worked before but not any more
now it might be because the CouchDB is actually configured correctly for cors
access now. Accessing a cors enabled server via a cors proxy is
problematic it seems. So check the database's direct address
carefully, because that should work now.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the port correct? For instance if you're CouchDB is on a https address the port is
probably 6984. </p></li>
<li><p>The second address is the default address for the
little CorsProxy server that enables access. If you have a different
cors proxy server that enables access to your CouchDB fill that in
there. </p></li>
<li><p>Can you open the default address for the CouchDB instance in
a browser window? For a local CouchDB this is for instance
<a href="">http://localhost:5984</a>. You should see a empty page with
something like:</p>

<p>{"couchdb":"Welcome","uuid":"4418cad0d9bd42aabccad6cd71d1b5eb","version":"1.3.0","vendor":{"version":"1.3.0","name":"The
Apache Software Foundation"}}</p></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The above tips assume you want the simplest setup possible. If you
don't want to enable cors for the CouchDB server you can use the
cors proxy server for all future access to the database. You will
have to run it every time before you use the roster app. You could
put it in the startup folder of windows. Your access will be through
the address http://localhost:1234. </p>

<p>If your setup is more complicated than above or it is not working contact me on <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6C;to:&#x6D;&#105;&#x63;&#x68;&#x69;&#x65;&#108;&#x6A;o&#x72;&#x69;&#115;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;i&#x6C;&#x2E;&#99;&#x6F;&#109;">&#x6D;&#105;&#x63;&#x68;&#x69;&#x65;&#108;&#x6A;o&#x72;&#x69;&#115;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;i&#x6C;&#x2E;&#99;&#x6F;&#109;</a></p></div>

It looks like we're accessing CouchDB through my cors proxy. 
<p>

You can choose not too modify CouchDB but you will have to keep running this cors
proxy so the roster app can access the database. 
</div>

<p>To enable cors and enable the roster app to access the database
directly a certain number of settings need to be applied.</p>

<p ng-show="!isAdminLoggedIn()">
 Please click the button right top and log in with server admin
 credentials so I can check whether cors settings have been configured correctly.
